# BookMarked!

## A Robust React.js Project that depicts the usage of a backend and database coupled with REST API Integration




## What is BookMarked!

**BookMarked! is a tool that can help you write reviews for books that you have read and to keep track of the books that you would like to read in the future, in just a few clicks.**
## Why BookMarked! 



Have you ever felt the pain of not remembering what books you have read and how do the books end? 

Fret not, you are not alone! 

BookMarked! was desgined to eradicate the pain of book lovers', like myself, who note down the books that they have read and give short reviews in their notebook or even in their phone. This is of course troublesome and not user attractive.
