## What is BookMarked!

**BookMarked! is a tool that can help you write reviews for books that you have read and to keep track of the books that you would like to read in the future, in just a few clicks.**
## Why BookMarked! 



Have you ever felt the pain of not remembering what books you have read and how do the books end? 

Fret not, you are not alone!
